# This plugin reminds you to use aliases when you type full commands. It helps
# build better shell habits by suggesting existing aliases for commands.
#
# Features:
# - Displays reminders when you type commands that have shorter aliases
# - Helps you learn and remember your configured aliases
# - Improves command line efficiency over time
# - Customizable reminder messages and behavior
#
# Example: If you type "git status" but have "gs" alias, it will remind you
